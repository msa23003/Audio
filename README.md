# README: Workflow for Text-to-Speech, Translation, and Audio Processing Tasks

## Overview
This document provides a detailed workflow for three tasks: converting HTML content to speech, translating text and audio content, and analyzing YouTube audio content. Each task is described step-by-step for better understanding.

---

## TASK 1: Text-to-Speech (HTML to Audio)
### Goal
Convert HTML content into an audio file using Google's Text-to-Speech API.

### Steps
1. **Input HTML Content**:
   - Users provide HTML content containing headings, paragraphs, and other tags.
2. **Language Detection**:
   - Detect the primary language of the input using the `langdetect` library.
3. **HTML to SSML Conversion**:
   - Normalize the HTML content.
   - Remove unnecessary tags while retaining the structure for better SSML processing.
4. **Voice Selection**:
   - List available voices based on the detected language.
   - Allow the user to select a preferred voice.
5. **Audio Configuration**:
   - User specifies pitch, rate, and volume adjustments for the generated audio.
6. **Generate Audio**:
   - The processed SSML content is converted into an audio file using the selected voice and configurations.
7. **Output**:
   - Save the audio as `output.mp3` and play it back to verify.

### Outcome
The HTML content is converted into a high-quality audio file.

## TASK 2: Translation Task
### Goal
Translate the text content within an HTML file to a target language while preserving the structure and formatting.

### Steps
1. **API Configuration**:
   - Use Google Generative AI with a predefined API key for the translation task.
2. **Input HTML File**:
   - User provides the path to the HTML file to be translated.
3. **Language Selection**:
   - Present a menu of target languages and accept user input for the desired language.
4. **Create Translation Prompt**:
   - Prepare a prompt instructing the model to translate text within HTML tags while keeping the structure intact.
5. **Model Translation**:
   - Send the prompt to the AI model and receive the translated HTML content.
6. **Output File**:
   - Save the translated content to a new HTML file named based on the target language (e.g., `Translated_hi.html`).

### Outcome
An HTML file with translated text content while retaining the original formatting.

## TASK 3: Audio Translation and Analysis
### Goal
Download audio from a YouTube video, process it for transcription, translate the transcription to a target language, and convert the translation to speech.

### Steps
1. **Download YouTube Audio**:
   - Use `yt_dlp` to download the audio as a `.wav` file.
   - Ensure a sample rate of 16,000 Hz for compatibility with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
2. **Split Audio**:
   - Divide the audio file into smaller chunks (10 seconds each) for efficient processing.
3. **Transcribe Audio**:
   - Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the audio content.
4. **Translate Transcription**:
   - Use Google Generative AI to translate the transcribed text into a target language while maintaining accuracy.
5. **Convert Translation to SSML**:
   - Process the translated text into SSML for text-to-speech conversion.
6. **Voice Selection and Audio Configuration**:
   - Present available voices for the target language.
   - Allow the user to select pitch, rate, and volume adjustments.
7. **Generate Audio**:
   - Convert the translated SSML content to an audio file using Google Text-to-Speech.
8. **Output**:
   - Save the final audio file as `output_audio.mp3`.

### Outcome
A translated audio file in the target language is generated from the YouTube video content.

## Notes
- **Dependencies**: Ensure the following packages are installed:
  - `google-cloud-texttospeech`
  - `gradio`
  - `pydub`
  - `langdetect`
  - `pytube`
  - `yt_dlp`
  - `librosa`
  - `soundfile`
- **APIs and Keys**:
  - Configure Google Cloud credentials and API keys before running the tasks.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Tasks include basic error handling, such as invalid file paths, unsupported languages, and retries for API calls.

## Summary
These tasks provide a seamless workflow for processing and translating text and audio content, leveraging Google Cloud APIs and open-source tools. The generated outputs (translated HTML and audio files) are ready for use in multilingual and multimedia applications.
